# Website Refactor Challenge - Accessibility

## Description

This project is a refactored version of a pre-existing website of Horiseon. The motivation behind this project is to improve the pre-existing website so that it is more accessible. Accessibility is very important when designing a webpage, it allows for a better experience for a broader set of users. The reason why this project was built is because while this website looks good, it lacks many styling elements that will make it more accessible for people with disabilities. By refactoring this website, it allows users will disabilities to understand the website and information better. It provides solutions for users who might be visually impaired while also preventing exclusion of certain set of users. Through refactoring of this website, I learned how important accessibility is and what helps increase accessibility for websites so that more users are able to use and understand the website.
