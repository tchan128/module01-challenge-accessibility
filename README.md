# Website Refactor Challenge - Accessibility

## Description

This project is a refactored version of a pre-existing website of Horiseon. The motivation behind this project is to improve the pre-existing website so that it is more accessible. Accessibility is very important when designing a webpage, it allows for a better experience for a broader set of users. The reason why this project was built is because while this website looks good, it lacks many styling elements that will make it more accessible for people with disabilities. By refactoring this website, it allows users will disabilities to understand the website and information better. It provides solutions for users who might be visually impaired while also preventing exclusion of certain set of users. Through refactoring of this website, I learned how important accessibility is and what helps increase accessibility for websites so that more users are able to use and understand the website. 

## Installation

## Usage

In this project, the website has been refactored to become more accessible for more users. After refactoring, users should be able to click onto each of the items on the navigation bar to bring them to the desired section of the webpage. Additionally, for users who have screen readers, images can now be read out to them so they understand what visual elements are there. If images fail to load on the webpage, users should also be able to refer to the alt text to get context. To take a look at the actual refactoring of the website, you can take a look at the HTML and CSS file itself to see what changes were made and why. These are made as comments for any elements/styles that were modified. 


## Credits

The starter code for this refactored website was from: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram/tree/main/Develop

Websites that helped the refactoring of the source code includes:

- https://digital.com/how-to-create-a-website/how-to-properly-structure-your-html-for-web-accessibility/
- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_accessibility.asp
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript

These websites helped point out what needs to be added/changed in both the CSS and HTML files to make the website more accessible. Some ideas I got off from there included, having proper headings/titles, including semantic HTML, and providing alt text for images.
